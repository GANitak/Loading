What is happening now?
Well i do my best to juggle between my day job and learning to 
build website, managed databases, and community service,
Understand the infrastructure & scale dynamic of social
media platforms, while learning the lingoo of the tech industry
What do i need to do ?
Write documentation & practice more in the terminal.
Use this page to write my process
Realize the the web is full of opinions and that there is
always an opportunity to learn, so when something feels off
Instead of pointing fingers, ask yourself why is it that way now
and How can we improve the situation, the beauty of tech is that
it's always evolving, and so call for change.
To better fit the needs of every groups in the world.
With respect for the other you will make the wheel turn faster!

```go
Ready to walk on the path of life again 
Keep dreaming, know how to keep going
Stay hopeful, regrets are lessons, desires are oxygen
Here it is again, love as begun.
Something frenetic, take it slow but go make it fun again
Play with your mind, let it shine.
We can't stop life, maybe you'll remember that.
Let me come back to you.

Ready to give some love
Keep dreaming, know i'll be there for you
Stay playful, i want you to be happy within
Here one more time, gimme that love.
How's full tank feel now? 
Like water touching your lips
Show me love everyday, i know you do.
Here some love... Flowing in the wind, remember to sing

I am off the hill, needed to make a living
I lost everything, and now i am too far away 
So far away
Some things can't stay, to show other colors
Getting ready to rise again
(...)
