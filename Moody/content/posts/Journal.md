## ----   ---   --- Here we are ---   ---   ----

```go
Ready to walk on the path of life again 
Keep dreaming, know how to keep going
Stay hopeful, regrets are lessons, desires are oxygen
Here it is again, love as begun.
Something frenetic, take it slow but go make it fun again
Play with your mind, let it shine.
We can't stop life, maybe you'll remember that.
Let me come back to you.

Ready to give some love
Keep dreaming, know i'll be there for you
Stay playful, i want you to be happy within
Here one more time, gimme that love.
How's full tank feel now? 
Like water touching your lips
Show me love everyday, i know you do.
Here some love... Flowing in the wind, remember to sing

I am off the hill, needed to make a living
I lost everything, and now i am too far away 
So far away
Some things can't stay, to show other colors
Getting ready to rise again
(...)
